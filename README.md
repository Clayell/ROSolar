# ROSolar

## What is it?
ROSolar creates solar panel parts via combining various solar panel models from external mods with rescaling features.


## Why is it needed?
ROSolar stems from a combined goal of reducing overall part clutter with the ability to affect solar panel performance when rescale the model.

Many players will typically install mods for specific spacecraft. This can lead to very large installs with parts that are unwanted just to get certain spacecraft. ROSolar, like other RO* Mods (ROCapsules, ROEngines) hopes to address some of those problems by offering a single source for specifically solar panel models.


## Who deserves the credit?
All the modders that used their time and considerable skills to develop the models, animations and textures that you see represented in game. Each part that is included inlcudes reference to the original modder that created the part. In all situations I have respected the licenses (as far as I know) and where authors could be reached, I received permission to include them. If you find anything that you do not think should belong, please let me know and I will remove them.
